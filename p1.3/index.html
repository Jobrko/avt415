    <h3>1. Actor - <span>Sinaht Valynore</span></h3>
    <h3>2. Motivator - <span>was invited by a DM friend to join his campaign</span></h3>
    <h3>3. Intention/Intent - <span>needs to get a fresh set of dice that go with her character and are
            relatively cheap</span></h3>
    <h3>4. Action - <span>browses the site that the DM recommended for starter sets. She ends up going through the
        specialty dice sets & normal sets before choosing a set that fit her the best. She also looked through the
        rolling trays to see if they matched the dice.</span></h3>
    <h3>5. Resolution - <span>She added the dice set she wanted & set a quantity, along with a dice tray that matched &
        placed her order online</span></h3>

    <p> Sinaht Valynore is a young woman who would love to start playing Dnd but doesn't know where to start. She asked
        a friend that she knows plays & he said that she should join his campaign he's going to be running. She says
    that she needs a new set of dice as her old ones have been lost & he recommends 'Goblins Horde' for starter sets.
    Sinaht browses through the site to find the perfect set of dice that represents the Changling character she has
    created & looks for a matching rolling tray. Once she has found them she places them in lher cart and places her
    order, eager to finally start playing Dnd!</p>
